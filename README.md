Key Insights
The dataset provides a rich array of information on businesses, users, and their interactions, including reviews, ratings, and compliments.

Cities with more reviews like Las Vegas and Phoenix are more likely to have businesses with better overall ratings and more user interaction.

Open businesses tend to have a higher number of reviews and better ratings, supporting the idea that active businesses are more successful.

The analysis of gender and city in terms of compliments revealed unexpected trends, showing how assumptions about user demographics can be challenged with actual data.
